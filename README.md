# CPCDS Mapping

This repository contains Diameter Health's default mapping for inbound CPCDS files. Each directory represents a file type and each directory includes three files:

1. A CSV file of just the default column headers.
2. A CSV file with the column headers and a row of the Diameter Health values they map to.
3. A JSON file representation of the above used by internal Diameter Health systems during ingestion.

Aside from this file, all files in this repo are auto-generated.
